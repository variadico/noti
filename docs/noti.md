Next, look for the "Hook Address" (or "Hook 地址" in Chinese), this is what you'll set `bearychat.incomingHookURI` to.

### Keybase

Log into your [Keybase] account and go to the Chat section.
Pick a team or user to send to, and set your `keybase.conversation` to that name. For teams, you can also specify a channel with `keybase.channel` or have it send to `general`. You can also send notifications that auto-delete with `keybase.explodingLifetime` set between `30s` (seconds) to `168h` (hours).

As long as the keybase service is running and the `keybase` binary is in your system path, you should be all set.

### Pushbullet

Log into your Pushbullet account. Next, click on [Settings] on the left sidebar.
Scroll down to "Access Tokens" and click "Create Access Token". The text that appears will be what you'll set `pushbullet.accessToken` to.

### Pushover

Log into your [Pushover] account. Next, look for the "User Key". That's what you'll set `pushover.userKey` to.

In the app you can create events to customize ringtone and vibration patterns for different kinds of notifications.
The event id you can set in the app, translates to `simplepush.event` in noti.

Development] page. Create a token. This is what you'll set `slack.token` to.

The variable `slack.channel` can be set to a channel like `#general` or
`#random`. You can also set it to someone's username, like `@jaime` or
`@variadico`.
